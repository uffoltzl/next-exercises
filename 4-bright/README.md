# Next 13 + Bright

This repo is for an exercise in my React course, [The Joy of React](https://joyofreact.com/).

## Running a development server

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

Then, start a local development server:

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

**Note:** Unlike create-react-app, we need to run the `dev` command, not `start`. The `start` command is used to run a _production_ server; we'll learn more about that later in the course.
